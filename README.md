# GFNumber
GField - a field givven by the user ; the default field is 2.
GFNumber - a number n which belongs to a givven GField
in this project we calculated the sum, substraction, multiplication, modulo between two GFNumbers
in addition , the prime numbers for each GFNumber  .

The GField consists of a long number p which have to be a prime number ,
 in addition to a long number l which have to be > 0.
The GFNumber itself consists of a long number value , and a GField instance thats the number belongs to . 
For finding the prime numbers we were asked to use Rho algorithim ,
in case of failure we asked to use tree division method . 
After calculating the required , the program will print the prime numbers .
